# FontFitColor (opensource)

This program is designed to substitute colored SVG-icons over existing TTF font glyphs.

If you do not plan to replace glyphs, add new glyphs in the font editor in advance (FontForge, GlyphrStudio). 

For custom icons, it is recommended to use the unicode range E000:F8FF "Private Use Area".
